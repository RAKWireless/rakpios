Driver for the TAS2505 speaker amp
==================================

Support for DAC speaker output only as that is the only option I have. Support
for analog input & headphone can be easily added though.

Control is through I2C.

Support for 44.1kHz & 48kHz at PLL input of 12.28MHz (or function in slave mode
with BCLK & WCLK input). Support for up to 50MHz PLL input & different sample
rates is possible by modifying tas2505_divs.

Test passed under kernel V5.10.
